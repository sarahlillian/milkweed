- heading: Chicago Needs Natural Habitat
  desc: Chicago is home to diverse native plants, animals and habitats. Natural habitats improve the quality of our air, water, soil and even promote mental health and wellbeing. Illinois lost nearly all of it’s original prairie and wetlands in the 1800s and 1900s - but we can bring it back!

- heading: Natual Habitats Need Milkweed

When those eggs hatch, Monarch caterpillars emerge and feast on milkweed leaves. Milkweeds are the only plants that Monarchs eat and Monarchs are an endangered species - they need our help!
